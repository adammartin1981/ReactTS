# React TS

This is a playground area to start from scratch (without create react app)
to create a React, Styled Components, Redux and Typescript project.

This will be created from various sources as well as existing knowledge
and used as a reference point for myself as well as testing new ideas.

## Wish List

* Typescript (Babel 7)
* HMR (Hot Module Reloading)
* Styled Components
* Redux
    * Using typed reducers
* SourceMaps for Typescript
* Chunked/Split Bundle
* Router V4
